# Weekly Planning Feature of The Preach My Gospel App
## A Quick Start Guide

**Introduction**

This quick start guide provides a walkthrough of how to use the new Weekly Planning feature in the Preach My Gospel app to set goals and make plans for all key indicators, while applying principles from Appendix 1 of Preach My Gospel. This guide helps missionaries and mentors plan together with unity and faith using the new digital tools available through the Preach My Gospel app. This process should replace any planning done on third-party mediums such as whiteboards, notebooks, and spreadsheets.
The purpose of weekly planning is to help missionaries center their efforts on the people they teach, seek revelation, and organize their work with purpose. When approached with the Spirit, weekly planning becomes an inspired process of setting meaningful goals that reflect the real needs and progress of individuals, rather than arbitrary numbers.

By following this guide, in-field mentors and missionaries will be able to:
Review and understand the spiritual and progress-based needs of those they teach.
Record and schedule inspired plans directly within the Preach My Gospel app.
Use the app to track commitments, set key indicator goals, and follow up on progress.

Before starting weekly planning, ensure that:
You have the Preach My Gospel app installed and are signed in to your assigned area.
You have reviewed Preach My Gospel, Chapter 8, “How Do I Use Time Wisely?” (page 152).
You have prayed for guidance and invited the Spirit to direct your planning session.

Planning is a spiritual experience. Focus on people, not statistics. When done with faith, weekly planning becomes an opportunity for revelation.

### **Step 1: Open Weekly Planning and Review New Members**
Open the Preach My Gospel app and tap Weekly Planning on the home screen. Under the People tab, look at New Members. Take note of the number of people with existing plans for the week. Understand how the “people” and “key indicators” tabs work together. There should be specific plans made for each interested person. For example, if you set a goal of 10 new members coming to church, you want to have 10 plans for that.

### **Step 2: Review Each Person’s Progress and Identify Concerns and Needs**
Scan through the list of people’s names and review each person’s progress. Take note of their sacrament attendance, commitments, and goals. Discuss their spiritual progress and their next step to come unto Christ based on the six key indicators for conversion. For example, new members who have been baptized in the past year still need constant nourishment and guidance through the sacrament. If you see that they haven’t attended recently, consider their concerns and situations based on your past appointments and inspiration from the spirit.

### **Step 3: Make and Record Inspired Plans in Detail**
Use Appendix 1 (page 156) to set goals, make plans after identifying their needs. Tap the + Commitments button to record an invitation (e.g., Read the Book of Mormon daily). Also tap + Plans to add a task, teaching, contact, or other activities. Record these plans in detail. For example, if a person’s need is a better understanding of the word of wisdom, make plans about what principles to revisit and how to teach them according to their understanding. However, you do not need to create full lesson plans at this point. Discuss such details in daily planning and companion study. Remember that weekly planning paints the big picture.

### **Step 4: Schedule Plans on the Calendar**
Tap Schedule from Calendar and select a specific date and time. Using this feature allows you to see empty spaces in your day and plot events accordingly. Save the event so it shows in both the calendar and planning view. This is essential to prime your daily planning sessions and keep them under the allotted 30 minutes. If done properly, you should have appointments plotted out for the entire week. By doing this early, you can focus your daily planning sessions on the needs of individuals instead and confirm appointments.

### **Step 5: Set and Confirm Weekly Goals Based on Plans**
Go to the Key Indicators tab, and set numeric goals for each key indicator. Check the plans you just made and confirm that they are aligned with each other. For example, if I made 10 plans for new members to attend the sacrament meeting, then I’ll set the weekly key indicator to 10 as well. Following this pattern ensures the weekly goals are grounded in meaningful discussion as opposed to random numbers that do not reflect the spiritual progress of the people in your area.

### **Conclusion**
Weekly planning is a sacred time for you to seek revelation and organize your efforts in harmony with the Lord’s will. Using the Preach My Gospel app allows you to combine spiritual insight with practical tools. This ensures that your inspired goals are recorded, scheduled, and acted upon. Remember to be productive, not busy.

As mentors and missionaries, follow this process each week. Use Appendix 1 for questions to consider to make your planning more meaningful and focused on the concerns and needs of your interested people and new members. This is a sure way to grow in your capacity to minister, teach, and lead others to Christ. As Preach My Gospel promises, “The Lord will magnify your efforts. You will grow in your capacity as an instrument in His hands” (p. 151).
